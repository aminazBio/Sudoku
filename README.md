# Sudoku
This is a program that detects whether the given 9x9 matrix is a sudoku or not.
Consider a 9x9 square. This square consists of 9 squares of 3x3. In this 9x9 square, numbers 1 to 9 should be placed in such a way that each number appears only once in each row, each column and each 3x3 square. In this case, we call the 9x9 square a sudoku.
